::: {#hero-heading}

I am currently studying at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, with a strong research interest in extreme hydrological events, global climate change, and eco-hydrology.  In my work, I utilize hydrological models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and PCR-GLOBWB to investigate and address complex research questions in these fields.

As a student exploring the path of scientific research, my dream is to contribute meaningfully to a world facing dynamic and multifaceted changes.

I enjoy contemplating my life and research while on long-distance rides.
